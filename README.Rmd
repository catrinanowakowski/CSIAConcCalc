The goal of CSIAConcCalc is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of CSIAConcCalc from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("catrinanowakowski/CSIAConcCalc")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CSIAConcCalc)

## Load data from a hand full of runs
data(df_runinfo)

## Calculated the mass that went into the machine on those runs
df_runinfo$massin <- calc_massinmachine(smp_mass = df_runinfo$smp_mass, 
                                        cut_vol = df_runinfo$cut, 
                                        EA_vol = df_runinfo$EA, 
                                        inj_vol = df_runinfo$inj)



```
```{r what mass should have been the goal }
#' Look at the peak size that resulted, and then calculated what mass would have
#' gone in if it was an ideal case
### CYNO BACTERIA
df_Carbon_cyno <- df_runinfo[df_runinfo$C_N == "C" & df_runinfo$species =="cyno", ]
df_Carbon_cyno$TargetMassIn <- calc_target_mass(goal_peak = 2500, 
                                                test_mass = df_Carbon_cyno$massin, 
                                                actual_peak = df_Carbon_cyno$peak_average)

                                                actual_peak = df_Nitrogen_cyno$peak_average)

df_Carbon_fish <- df_runinfo[df_runinfo$C_N == "C" & df_runinfo$species =="fish", ]

                                                actual_peak = df_Carbon_fish$peak_average)

df_Nitrogen_fish <- df_runinfo[df_runinfo$C_N == "N" & df_runinfo$species =="fish", ]

                                                actual_peak = df_Nitrogen_fish$peak_average)

mean(df_Carbon_fish$TargetMassIn)   ## 0.0015 mg of fish for carbon 
mean(df_Nitrogen_fish$TargetMassIn) ## 0.0314 mg of fish for nitrogen 




```


```{r EA volume}


### Example for how to calculate the EA volume to dilute the sample at all 
## possible injection sizes
calc_EA_vol(smp_mass = df_Carbon_cyno$smp_mass[1], cut_vol = 100, massinmachine = 0.002)
calc_EA_vol(smp_mass = df_Carbon_fish$smp_mass[1], cut_vol = 100, massinmachine = 0.0015)


```



```{r other notes}

### Need a new starting point target mass for coral samples: 
### We know the percent carbon and nitrogen for the black seabass from bulk data 
## 42.75% Carbon 13.23% Nitrogen 
## Using the average mass in for carbon and nitrogen for the black sea bass we see
## its about 6.4117 *10^-4 mg of carbon to get peaks of about 3000
## and then it's about 1.979 *10^-4 mg of nitrogen to get peaks of about 1000

## These are all division C/N below 
# C 0.0015mg => 0.0015         = 0.0015         *0.4275 = 6.4*10^-7 =3.2 which is about 3000/1000 which would be the mv ratio
# N 0.0314mg => 0.0314(*0.477) = 0.0314(*0.477) *0.1323 = 1.9*10^-7
#                      *fraction to make mass the same...
# This gives:
## C 2.137 *10^-7/mv
## N 1.979 *10^-7/mv

# So a good starting point would be to aim for about 2*10^-7/mv for a new species 
# Things that could change this are species by species
# Error from Lab work 
# Machine sensitivity and repairs 

## So say we have 42.8%C and 16%N
# 40/100 =2*10^-7(3000mv)/x x = 0.0014 mg as a starting weight
# 16/100 =2*10^-7(1000mv)/x  x = 0.00125 mg as 

```
