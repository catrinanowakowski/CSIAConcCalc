The goal of CSIAConcCalc is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the released version of CSIAConcCalc from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("CSIAConcCalc")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(CSIAConcCalc)

## Load data from a hand full of runs
data(df_runinfo)

## Calculated the mass that went into the machine on those runs
df_runinfo$massin <- calc_massinmachine(smp_mass = df_runinfo$smp_mass, 
                                        cut_vol = df_runinfo$cut, 
                                        EA_vol = df_runinfo$EA, 
                                        inj_vol = df_runinfo$inj)
```

``` r
#' Look at the peak size that resulted, and then calculated what mass would have
#' gone in if it was an ideal case
### CYNO BACTERIA

                                                actual_peak = df_Carbon_cyno$peak_average)

### Need a new starting point target mass for coral samples: 
### We know the percent carbon and nitrogen for the black seabass from bulk data 
## 42.75% Carbon 13.23% Nitrogen 
## Using the average mass in for carbon and nitrogen for the black sea bass we see
## its about 6.4117 *10^-4 mg of carbon to get peaks of about 3000
## and then it's about 1.979 *10^-4 mg of nitrogen to get peaks of about 1000

# This gives:
## C 2.137 *10^-7/mv
## N 1.979 *10^-7/mv

# So a good starting point would be to aim for about 2*10^-7/mv for a new species 
# Things that could change this are species by species
# Error from Lab work 
# Machine sensitivity and repairs
